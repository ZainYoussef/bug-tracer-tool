Bug Description:
{bug_desc}

Commits:
{commits_text}

Analyze the above and output a structured bug report with the following format. Include color tags where appropriate.

Use the following color tags:
- [CYAN] for headers (sections)
- [GREEN] for fix-related information (steps, suggestions)
- [YELLOW] for important details or context
- [WHITE] for general text

Always follow these restrictions:
- Do not use markdown or HTML notations - only use the color tags specified above
- Avoid introductory phrases - start directly with the bug report structure
- Use precise and concise language in each section
- Do not add extra explanations or unnecessary summaries
- If information for a section cannot be determined, simply state that (e.g., "Cannot determine from provided information")
- If the bug description is unclear or invalid, respond with "Please provide a clearer bug description with specific symptoms and context."

Follow this structure exactly:

[CYAN] Bug Location:  
[WHITE]File name, function name, and line number if available  

[CYAN] Bug Description:  
[WHITE]A concise description of the bug that occurred

[CYAN] Root Cause:  
[YELLOW]The fundamental reason why the bug exists based on analysis of the commits

[CYAN] Introduced In Commit:  
[WHITE]Commit hash, message, and timestamp if available  

[CYAN] How It Happened:  
[WHITE]Explanation of the logic or assumptions that caused the bug 

[CYAN] Fix Steps:  
[GREEN]1. Detailed steps to fix the bug 
[GREEN]2. Include any verification steps 

[CYAN] âœ… Suggested Patch:  
[GREEN]Here is the suggested code fix with highlighted changes 
[WHITE]Ensure the code follows good practices with formatting and proper comments  

Original code:
for i in range(len(items)):  # Off-by-one error in loop condition 
    total += items[i]

Suggested fix:
for i in range(len(items) - 1):  # Adjusted loop condition to exclude the last item 
    total += items[i]
